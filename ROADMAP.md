---

## Phase 3: Gamification & Advanced Point System (✅ Phase 3a COMPLETE)

**Status**: Phase 3a Complete, Phase 3b Starting

### Phase 3a: New Point Scoring System (✅ COMPLETE)

**Status**: ✅ Tested and Verified (Oct 27)

**Goal**: Incentivize learning, not clicking. Penalize careless attempts.

**New Rules (Implemented & Tested):**
1. **Pass (70%+ accuracy)**: Award full points ✅
   - Example: 100% accuracy on 12-point quiz = +12 points
2. **Fail (50-69% accuracy)**: Award 0 points ✅
3. **Fail (<50% accuracy)**: Deduct points ✅
   - Deduction: Half of total possible points
   - Example: 0% accuracy on 12-point quiz = -6 points
4. **Retakes**: No additional points if already passed ✅
   - Button disabled after first pass (prevents farming)
   - Users cannot retake passed quizzes
5. **Total Points**: Accurately calculated across all attempts ✅

**Implementation Details:**
- Modified `QuizAttemptController.calculatePointsToAward()`
- Changed deduction logic to use `request.getTotalPoints()` instead of `request.getScore()`
- Retake prevention checks database for passing attempts (70%+ accuracy)
- Quiz button disabled via `ReadingMaterial` component state

**Code Changes:**
- `QuizAttemptController.java` line 84: Fixed deduction calculation
- All gamification rules implemented in `calculatePointsToAward()` method

**Test Results (Oct 27):**
- ✅ Quiz 1: 0% accuracy → **-6 points** (deduct half of 12)
- ✅ Quiz 2: 100% accuracy → **+12 points** (full reward, no previous pass)
- ✅ Button disabled after first pass
- ✅ Point calculation: -6 + 12 = **6 total points** ✅
- ✅ Dashboard displays correct totals
- ✅ Cannot click quiz button after passing

**Timeline**: Oct 24-27 (Completed)

---

### Phase 3b: Quiz Batching & Mastery System (⏳ NEXT)

**Status**: Not Started

**Goal**: Organize quizzes into 10-question batches with mastery thresholds.

**Features to Implement:**
1. Quiz batching (10 questions per batch)
2. 80% mastery threshold for batch completion
3. Can't move to next batch until current batch mastered
4. Retake system for failed batches
5. Progress tracking per batch
6. Visual batch progress display

**Implementation Plan:**
- Add `QuizBatch` entity (groups 10 questions)
- Add `BatchProgress` entity (tracks completion/mastery)
- Create `BatchController` endpoints
- Update `Quiz.jsx` to load batch questions
- Add UI for batch progress display
- Modify quiz flow to enforce mastery before advancement

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Questions grouped into 10-question batches
- [ ] Users cannot proceed to next batch without 80% accuracy
- [ ] Progress tracking per batch works
- [ ] Can retake failed batches
- [ ] UI shows current batch and progress

**Timeline**: Oct 28-29 (Planned)

---

### Phase 3c: Polish & Bug Fixes (⏳ NEXT)

**Outstanding Issues:**
- "Read about this topic" button navigation bug
  - Fix: Restructure navigation or remove feature
  - Deferred to Phase 4

- localStorage validation on app startup
  - Add check: if token exists but user not in DB, clear localStorage
  - Impact: Minor - only affects testing

**Timeline**: Oct 29 (After Phase 3b)

---

## Phase 4: Additional Features (Future)

- Fix "Read about this topic" anchor links
- localStorage validation
- Premium tier & Stripe payments
- Competitive mode with leaderboards
- Mobile app (React Native)
- Internationalization (5 languages)
- Chapter-level progress display
- Automated testing framework

---

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Stack
- Spring Boot 3.5.5 (Java 21)
- Spring Data JPA / Hibernate
- H2 (dev), PostgreSQL (prod)
- JWT + BCrypt authentication

### Frontend Stack
- React + Vite
- react-markdown for content
- React hooks for state management

### Database Schema (Current)
```
periods → topics → chapters → questions → question_options
users → quiz_attempts (links to chapters)
users → user_progress (links to topics)

// Phase 3 additions:
quiz_batches (groups 10 questions per chapter)
batch_progress (tracks user's mastery per batch)
```

---

## Session Notes

**Oct 24 - Phase 2 Completion:**
- Quiz attempts save only once (fixed useRef issue)
- Progress calculation working correctly
- Dashboard displaying all stats accurately
- All DEBUG logs removed
- Ready for Phase 3

**Oct 24 - Phase 3a Planning:**

- Quiz batching: 10 questions per batch
- Mastery: 80% accuracy required

**Oct 27 - Phase 3a Completion:**
- ✅ Retake prevention bug fixed (used wrong variable in calculation)

## Key Decisions (Oct 24-27)

**Decision 22: useRef for duplicate prevention**
- Use useRef instead of sessionStorage/localStorage
- Prevents React Strict Mode double-call
- More reliable than timestamp checking
- Impact: Single quiz save guaranteed

**Decision 23: 70% mastery threshold**
- Not too harsh (80% was too hard)
- Encourages learning without frustration
- Can adjust based on user feedback

**Decision 24: Phase 3 order**
- Point system first (simpler) ✅ DONE
- Then batching (builds on point system) ⏳ NEXT
- Then polish
- Allows testing/adjustment before batching

**Decision 27: Deduction calculation** (Oct 27)
- Use `request.getTotalPoints()` not `request.getScore()`
- Deduct half of total possible points (not based on score which is 0)
- Example: 0% on 12-point quiz = -6 (half of 12)
- Rationale: Penalizes carelessness, not difficulty of questions

---

## Known Issues & Technical Debt

**Fixed Issues:**
- ✅ Retake prevention not working → FIXED (Oct 27)
  - Root cause: Used wrong variable in deduction
  - Solution: Changed to `request.getTotalPoints()`

**Current Issues (Minor):**
- "Read about this topic" button navigation bug
  - Deferred to Phase 4
- DEBUG logs still in QuizAttemptController
  - Can be cleaned up in next pass
- localStorage validation on app startup missing
  - Minor issue, affects testing only

**Technical Debt:**
- No automated tests
- No CI/CD pipeline
- Database not indexed for production
- No logging/monitoring
