# Historical Quiz Application - Product Roadmap
**Last Updated**: October 22, 2025

## Phase 1: Core Foundation (98% Complete) ‚úÖ

**Completed Today (October 22):**
- ‚úÖ Question randomization (backend: Collections.shuffle())
- ‚úÖ Answer shuffling (frontend: Fisher-Yates algorithm)
- ‚úÖ Bulk import endpoint for questions (`POST /api/questions/bulk-import`)
- ‚úÖ API_BASE_URL configuration for consistency across all frontend API calls
- ‚úÖ CORS preflight handling (OPTIONS requests in JWT filter)
- ‚úÖ TopicForm with period selector dropdown (fixed missing periodId issue)
- ‚úÖ Markdown rendering with react-markdown library
- ‚úÖ Successfully imported 30 Paleolithic Era questions
- ‚úÖ Increased chapter content column size (10,000 ‚Üí 50,000 characters)
- ‚úÖ Created complete Period ‚Üí Topic ‚Üí Chapter ‚Üí Question hierarchy

**Previously Completed:**
- ‚úÖ Difficulty levels for questions
- ‚úÖ Text references (anchor links to reading material)
- ‚úÖ Scroll-to-edit UX with reusable `scrollToFormInput()` utility
- ‚úÖ Full admin CRUD for periods, topics, chapters, questions
- ‚úÖ Results screen with "Read about this" navigation
- ‚úÖ Scoring system based on difficulty
- ‚úÖ File-based H2 database persistence

**Bug Fixes (Latest):**
- ‚úÖ Fixed CORS errors by adding OPTIONS method handling in JWT filter
- ‚úÖ Fixed TopicForm missing periodId - now requires period selection
- ‚úÖ Fixed chapter content length limit
- ‚úÖ Fixed markdown content rendering (not showing raw MD syntax)

**Remaining Minor Tasks:**
1. ‚¨ú **Polish markdown rendering** - Remove visible `{#anchor-id}` from headings (use remark plugins)
2. ‚¨ú **Quiz batching UI** - Display "10 questions per batch" messaging (logic already works)
3. ‚¨ú **Error handling & loading states** - Improve UX during data fetching

**How to Verify Phase 1 Works:**
1. Navigate to Prehistory ‚Üí Paleolithic Era
2. Click "Start Quiz"
3. Verify: 10 random questions load each time
4. Answer a question wrong
5. Click "Read about this" - should jump to correct section in reading material

---

## Phase 2: User Authentication & Progress (NEXT - Starting Tomorrow)

**Why Now:** Phase 1 is essentially complete. Randomization and answer shuffling work perfectly. Authentication will unlock persistent user data needed for batching and progress tracking.

**Timeline:** ~2 weeks

**Backend Tasks:**
1. Create User entity (username, email, passwordHash, accountType, premiumExpiryDate)
2. Create QuizAttempt entity (track individual quiz attempts)
3. Create UserProgress entity (track mastery per topic)
4. Implement JWT authentication with Spring Security
5. Create registration/login endpoints
6. Add @Secured annotations to quiz endpoints
7. Build progress calculation logic

**Frontend Tasks:**
1. Build Sign Up / Sign In pages
2. Create user dashboard (progress, history, stats)
3. Implement protected routes
4. Add logout functionality
5. Display user context throughout app
6. Show progress per topic/chapter

**Database Changes:**
- New users table
- New quiz_attempts table
- New user_progress table
- Foreign key constraints

**Success Criteria for Phase 2:**
- Users can register and login
- Quiz attempts are saved to database
- Users see their progress on dashboard
- Persistent progress tracking working

---

## Phase 3: Quiz Features with Persistence (After Phase 2)

Now that users exist, add these in order:

1. **Quiz batching** (3-4 hours) - 10 questions per batch, 80% mastery threshold, retake logic
2. **Quiz history** - Show past attempts, track improvement over time
3. **Mastery tracking** - Display topics where user achieved 80%+ accuracy

**Key: All attempts now saved to database and associated with user**

---

## Technical Stack

### Backend
- Spring Boot 3.5.5 (Java 21)
- Spring Data JPA
- H2 (development), PostgreSQL (production)
- JWT authentication
- RESTful API

### Frontend
- React + Vite
- react-markdown for content rendering
- API_BASE_URL for configuration
- Functional components with hooks

### Database
```
Period ‚Üí Topic ‚Üí Chapter ‚Üí Question (4 options)
         ‚Üì
      User ‚Üí QuizAttempt (Phase 2)
         ‚Üì
      UserProgress (Phase 2)
```

---

## Key Decisions

**Decision 14:** Use `react-markdown` for rendering markdown content - Avoids manual HTML entry and keeps content portable.

**Decision 15:** Defer markdown anchor ID cleanup to after Phase 2 - Current implementation works for navigation, polish is lower priority.

**Decision 16:** Bulk import endpoint over UI initially - Faster data loading during development, can build import UI later.

**Decision 17:** TopicForm requires period selection - Prevents orphaned topics, enforces data integrity at UI level.

---

## Known Issues & Technical Debt

**Resolved:**
- ‚úÖ CORS preflight requests blocking API calls
- ‚úÖ Missing periodId in topic creation

CREATE TABLE periods (id, title, description);
CREATE TABLE topics (id, title, description, period_id);
CREATE TABLE chapters (id, title, content, topic_id);
CREATE TABLE questions (id, question, correct_answer, difficulty, text_reference, chapter_id);
CREATE TABLE question_options (question_id, option);

-- Phase 2
CREATE TABLE users (id, username, email, password_hash, account_type, stripe_customer_id, premium_expiry_date);
CREATE TABLE quiz_attempts (id, user_id, chapter_id, score, total_questions, total_points, attempt_date);
CREATE TABLE user_progress (id, user_id, topic_id, total_points, questions_answered, questions_correct, last_studied);
```

---

## Key Decisions

**Decision 11:** Reusable form utilities (formUtils.js) - DRY principle, consistent UX

**Decision 12:** Defer quiz batching to Phase 2 - Better UX with persistent user data; prevents refactoring

**Decision 13:** Auth first, then features - Build foundation correctly rather than retrofitting later

---

## Known Issues & Technical Debt

**Resolved:**
- ‚úÖ TextReference not saving - Fixed QuestionController
- ‚úÖ Scroll-to-edit UX - Implemented with utility function
- ‚úÖ Missing chapter UI - Already exists in admin panel

## Notes

This is a living document. Update it as you complete phases and learn new things. The goal is a single source of truth for the project's progress and vision.

Current focus: **Finish Phase 1 (randomization), then move to Phase 2 (auth).**

### Important Design Decisions

**No Subchapter Entity**: Chapters contain one continuous reading material with HTML structure (H2/H3 headings) for organization. This keeps the data model simple while maintaining content structure.

**Questions Link to Text**: Each question has a `textReference` field (anchor link) pointing to the relevant section in the reading material. When users answer incorrectly, they can click to read the related content.

**Example Structure:**
```
Topic: Ancient Rome
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Reading Material (one continuous document)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Chapter 1: Roman Kingdom (H2)
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Foundation of Rome (H3) #roman-kingdom-foundation
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ The Seven Kings (H3) #seven-kings
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Chapter 2: Roman Republic (H2)
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Early Republic (H3) #early-republic
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Sulla's Dictatorship (H3) #sulla-dictatorship
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... continues
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Questions
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Q1: "Who was the first king?" ‚Üí textReference: "#seven-kings"
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Q2: "When was Rome founded?" ‚Üí textReference: "#roman-kingdom-foundation"
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

## üéÆ Feature Breakdown

### 1. Reading Material System

**Current Implementation:**
- One continuous document per topic
- Uses H2/H3 HTML headings for structure
- Scrollable, free navigation
- No separate pages per chapter

**User Experience:**
- Users can read entire topic history in one flow
- Can jump to specific sections via table of contents
- Can search within the text
- Mobile-friendly reading experience

**Technical Details:**
```java
// Chapter model
@Entity
public class Chapter {
    private Long id;
    private String title;
    @Column(length = 10000)
    private String content; // HTML content with <h2>, <h3> tags
    private Topic topic;
    private List<Question> questions;
}
```

```jsx
// Frontend rendering
<div className="reading-content">
    <h2 id="roman-kingdom">Roman Kingdom</h2>
    <h3 id="foundation">Foundation of Rome</h3>
    <p>Content about foundation...</p>
    <h3 id="seven-kings">The Seven Kings</h3>
    <p>Content about the kings...</p>
</div>
```

**Database Schema Update:**
```java
@Entity
public class Question {
    private Long id;
    private String question;
    private List<String> options; // 4 options
    private int correctAnswer; // index 0-3
    private int difficulty; // 1, 2, or 3
    private String textReference; // anchor link, e.g., "#roman-kingdom-foundation"
    private Chapter chapter;
}
```

**Scoring System:**
- Base points by difficulty level
- Time bonus (competitive mode): +5 points if answered in <10 seconds
- Streak bonus: +2 points per consecutive correct answer
- No penalty for wrong answers (learning-focused)

**Anti-Memorization Features:**
1. **Randomize question order** - Questions appear in random order each time
2. **Shuffle answer options** - A, B, C, D positions change every quiz
3. **Question pool rotation** - More questions than shown per quiz

**Implementation:**
```java
// Backend: Random question selection
@Query("SELECT q FROM Question q WHERE q.chapter.id = :chapterId ORDER BY RANDOM()")
List<Question> findRandomQuestionsByChapter(@Param("chapterId") Long chapterId);
```

```javascript
// Frontend: Shuffle answer options
const shuffleOptions = (question) => {
    const shuffled = [...question.options];
    const correctAnswer = shuffled[question.correctAnswer];

    // Fisher-Yates shuffle
    for (let i = shuffled.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
        const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));
        [shuffled[i], shuffled[j]] = [shuffled[j], shuffled[i]];
    }

    return {
        options: shuffled,
        correctAnswer: shuffled.indexOf(correctAnswer)
    };
};
```

---

### 3. Results & Learning Integration

**After Quiz Completion:**
- Show score and percentage
- Display all questions with user's answers
- Highlight correct/incorrect answers
- **For wrong answers**: "üìñ Read about this" button

**Text Reference Feature:**
```jsx
// Results.jsx
{incorrectQuestions.map(q => (
    <div key={q.id} className="question-review">
        <h4>{q.question}</h4>
        <p className="wrong">Your answer: {q.userAnswer}</p>
        <p className="correct">Correct answer: {q.correctAnswer}</p>

        {q.textReference && (
            <a
                href={`/reading/${topicId}${q.textReference}`}
                className="read-more-btn"
            >
                üìñ Read about this topic
            </a>
        )}
    </div>
))}
```

**Learning Loop:**
1. User takes quiz on "Roman Kingdom"
2. Gets 7/10 correct
3. Sees 3 questions they missed
4. Clicks "Read about this" on each
5. Navigates directly to relevant reading section
6. Can retake quiz after reviewing

   ```javascript
   // Prevent copying questions
   onCopy={(e) => e.preventDefault()}
   onCut={(e) => e.preventDefault()}
   onPaste={(e) => e.preventDefault()}
   ```

2. **Disable right-click**
   ```javascript
   onContextMenu={(e) => e.preventDefault()}
   ```

3. **Tab detection** - Track if user switches tabs (suspicious activity)
   ```javascript
   useEffect(() => {
       const handleVisibilityChange = () => {
           if (document.hidden) {
               // Log suspicious activity
               setSuspiciousActivityCount(prev => prev + 1);
           }
       };
       document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', handleVisibilityChange);
   }, []);
   ```

4. **Time tracking** - Server validates completion time

**Prize Distribution:**
- Weekly tournaments
- Top 10 get rewards
- Prize pool: % of subscription revenue
- Payouts via Stripe Connect or PayPal

**Legal Considerations:**
- May need gambling license depending on jurisdiction

- Russian
- Spanish
- German

**Implementation Strategy:**

**Phase 1: UI Translation** (react-i18next)
```javascript
// English
{
  "button.start_quiz": "Start Quiz",
  "button.submit": "Submit Answer",
  "nav.reading": "Reading Material"
}

// German
{
  "button.start_quiz": "Quiz starten",
  "button.submit": "Antwort absenden",
  "nav.reading": "Lesematerial"
}
```

**Phase 2: Content Translation** (Database schema change)
```java
@Entity
public class ChapterTranslation {
    private Long id;
    private String language; // ISO 639-1: "en", "de", "es", "bg", "ru"
    private String title;
    private String content;

    @ManyToOne
    private Chapter chapter;
}

@Entity
public class QuestionTranslation {
    private Long id;
    private String language;
    private String question;
    private List<String> options;

    @ManyToOne
    private Question question;
}
```

**Language Switching:**
- User selects language in profile
- All UI elements update instantly
- Content fetched in selected language
- Fallback to English if translation missing

**Translation Workflow:**
1. Content created in English (base language)
2. Professional translators hired for each target language
3. Translations stored in database
4. Quality review by native speakers
5. Deployed per language

**Cost Estimation:**
- Professional translation: $0.08-0.15 per word
- Average chapter: 2,000 words = $160-$300 per chapter
- Budget accordingly for content library

## üìù Notes & Decisions Log

### Key Decisions Made

**Decision 1: No Subchapter Entity**
- Date: October 2025
- Rationale: Adding another database layer would increase complexity without significant benefit. HTML structure (H2/H3) provides sufficient organization while keeping the data model simple.
- Impact: Easier to maintain, faster development, simpler queries

**Decision 2: Question Difficulty Levels (1-3)**
- Date: October 2025
- Rationale: Three levels provide good granularity without overwhelming users or admins. Simple integer field easy to implement and understand.
- Impact: Better scoring system, progressive difficulty, more engaging gameplay

**Decision 3: Text References via Anchor Links**
- Date: October 2025
- Rationale: Using HTML anchors (#section-id) is simple, reliable, and works across web and mobile. No complex routing needed.
- Impact: Seamless integration between quiz results and reading material, better learning outcomes

**Decision 4: React Native for Mobile**
- Date: October 2025
- Rationale: Maximizes code reuse with existing React web app, faster development, one codebase for both platforms.

- Rationale: Low barrier to entry encourages conversions, competitive with similar educational platforms, sustainable revenue at scale.
- Impact: Accessible pricing, predictable revenue stream

**Decision 8: File-Based H2 Database**
- Date: October 2025
- Rationale: In-memory database was losing data on server restart. Switched to file-based storage to persist data across restarts.
- Configuration: `spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:file:./data/quizdb` with `ddl-auto=none`
- Impact: Data persistence, easier development, no data loss on restart

**Decision 9: Text References Implementation**
- Date: October 2025
- Rationale: Implemented complete text reference flow - questions link to reading sections, Results component shows "Read about this" button, navigation works via state management in App.jsx
- Impact: Better learning outcomes, seamless integration between quiz and reading material, tested and working

**Decision 10: Next Priority - Chapter CRUD**
- Date: October 2025
- Rationale: Need admin interface to easily manage chapter content (add/edit/delete) instead of manual SQL updates
- Impact: Faster content creation, better admin UX, enables non-technical content creators
