# Early Rome & the Kingdom: The Foundation of an Empire (753-509 BCE)

## Introduction to the Regal Period

The history of Rome begins not with empirical historical records, but with legend—a blend of mythology, religious tradition, and the gradual emergence of archaeological evidence. The period known as the Regal Period, or Kingdom of Rome, spans from the traditional founding date of 753 BCE to the fall of the monarchy in 509 BCE. During these two and a half centuries, Rome transformed from a small settlement of shepherds and farmers on the Tiber River into a significant regional power in central Italy, complete with sophisticated political institutions, a distinctive socio-economic structure, and cultural practices that would endure for centuries.

The sources for understanding Early Rome are uniquely challenging. Unlike ancient Greece, which had written records from an early period, Rome's earliest history was preserved primarily through oral tradition, later compiled into literary narratives by historians such as Livy (Titus Livius, 59 BCE - 17 CE) and Plutarch (46-120 CE), who wrote centuries after the events they described. These sources blend historical fact with legendary embellishment, making it necessary to approach them critically. Archaeological evidence, including pottery fragments, architectural remains, and burial sites excavated on the Palatine Hill and Roman Forum, provides crucial corroboration and often challenges or refines the literary accounts.

## The Foundation Myth: Romulus and Remus

### The Legend

According to Roman tradition, Rome was founded on April 21, 753 BCE by Romulus, a descendant of the Trojan hero Aeneas. The story, as told primarily by Livy and Plutarch, unfolds as follows: Aeneas, fleeing the destruction of Troy, settled in Latium and married Lavinia, the daughter of the local king. Their descendants ruled Alba Longa, a city in the Alban Hills, until King Numitor was overthrown by his brother Amulius. To prevent any challenge to his rule, Amulius forced Numitor's daughter, Rhea Silvia, to become a Vestal Virgin—sworn to chastity and service to the goddess Vesta.

However, the god Mars seduced Rhea Silvia, and she gave birth to twin sons: Romulus and Remus. Amulius, viewing the twins as a threat, ordered them drowned in the Tiber River. The infants were placed in a basket that washed ashore. A she-wolf (lupa) found them and nursed them; a shepherd named Faustulus discovered them and raised them as his own. As adults, the brothers learned their true identity, overthrew Amulius, and restored their grandfather Numitor to the throne.

The brothers then decided to found a new city on the Tiber, but disagreed about its location. According to legend, Romulus favored the Palatine Hill, while Remus preferred the Aventine Hill. They decided to consult the auspices (divine signs) by observing birds. Romulus reportedly saw twelve vultures, while Remus saw only six. Romulus claimed victory and began building walls around the Palatine. In anger, Remus either jumped over the wall in mockery (according to some accounts) or was killed by Romulus for transgressing the sacred boundary. Romulus thus became sole founder and first king of Rome.

### Historical Reality vs. Legend

While the Romulus and Remus story is unquestionably mythological, archaeological evidence confirms that Rome's location was strategically chosen. The Palatine Hill, where Romulus was said to have founded the city, overlooks a crossing point of the Tiber River and natural defensive positions. Excavations have revealed hut settlements dating to around 1000 BCE on the Palatine, indicating continuous habitation. The settlement grew gradually, absorbing neighboring communities on surrounding hills (Esquiline, Quirinal, Viminal, Caelian, and Aventine). By the 8th century BCE, these separate villages began to coalesce into a unified urban center, a process that likely took several generations rather than occurring in a single founding act.

The mythological narrative served important purposes in Roman culture: it provided a divine origin for the city, connected Rome to the broader Greco-Trojan epic tradition, and justified Rome's dominance by claiming descent from gods and heroes. For Romans, the legend was functionally true, expressing deeper truths about their identity and destiny even if the literal details were fabricated.

## The Seven Kings of Rome

Roman tradition held that Rome was ruled by seven kings before the establishment of the Republic in 509 BCE. The historical reliability of these accounts varies considerably, with the early kings being largely legendary and the later kings more firmly grounded in historical reality. Below are the seven kings and their traditionally ascribed accomplishments:

### 1. Romulus (753-716 BCE)

The legendary founder is credited with establishing the city's basic institutions. According to tradition, Romulus organized the population into three tribes and a Senate, established the assembly of the people (Comitia Curiata), and instituted the religious calendar and rituals. He is also said to have created the legend of the Rape of the Sabines—the abduction of Sabine women by Roman men to secure wives and integrate the Sabine population into Rome.

Historicity: Highly doubtful; likely represents a composite of early Roman development.

### 2. Numa Pompilius (715-673 BCE)

Numa is depicted as a peaceful king from the Sabine town of Cures who brought religious and cultural refinement to Rome. He is credited with establishing most of Rome's religious practices: the priesthoods, the Vestal Virgins, the calendar, and various ceremonies. He supposedly had a supernatural advisor, the nymph Egeria, who counseled him on religious matters.

Historicity: Probably legendary, though religious developments did occur gradually during this period. Numa may represent the cultural contributions of the Sabine element of the population.

### 3. Tullus Hostilius (673-642 BCE)

Representing a return to martial values after Numa's peaceful reign, Tullus is described as a warlike king who expanded Roman territory through conquest. He is credited with destroying Alba Longa, Rome's rival Latin city, and incorporating its population into Rome. The encounter between the two cities was reportedly decided by the combat of three champions from each side (the Horatii and Curiatii), a practice that reflected early Indo-European combat traditions.

Historicity: Likely contains some historical kernel; Alba Longa was indeed absorbed into Roman territory during this period, though the circumstances are uncertain.

### 4. Ancus Marcius (642-616 BCE)

Ancus Marcius is said to have combined the martial virtues of Tullus with the piety of Numa. He is credited with extending Roman territory, building fortifications, and establishing the port settlement of Ostia at the mouth of the Tiber to facilitate trade. He is also associated with the construction of the first bridge across the Tiber (the Pons Sublicius).

Historicity: Moderate; some infrastructure developments (particularly port facilities) likely occurred during this period, though specific attributions are uncertain.

### 5. Tarquinius Priscus (616-579 BCE)

The first of the Tarquin kings, Tarquinius Priscus is described as a foreigner, possibly of Etruscan origin, whose reign marked a significant transformation of Rome. He is credited with founding the Circus Maximus for chariot racing, beginning construction of the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitoline Hill (the greatest temple in Rome), and reorganizing the army. He is also said to have increased the Senate from 100 to 200 members.

Historicity: Good; the increasing Etruscan influence during this period is well-attested archaeologically. Major building projects and institutional reforms likely occurred, though specific dates are uncertain.

### 6. Servius Tullius (579-534 BCE)

Servius Tullius, possibly of Etruscan origin (his name may be Etruscan), is credited with transforming Rome's political and military organization. He allegedly replaced the three tribal divisions with four urban tribes and a rural area (ager), creating a more inclusive system that incorporated conquered populations. Most significantly, he reorganized the army and the political assembly (Comitia Centuriata) based on the "Servian Constitution," dividing citizens into classes based on wealth and military capability.

This system created a formal citizenship structure that would endure for centuries: citizens were ranked into five property classes (based on landed wealth), each class subdivided into centuries for military organization and voting. Below the five classes were the proletarii (property-less citizens) and slaves. This system gave greater political weight to wealthy landowners while providing formal participation rights to smaller farmers and citizens.

Historicity: Good; the Servian military and political reforms are well-attested and represent genuine historical developments, though some details may be stylized.

### 7. Tarquinius Superbus (534-509 BCE)

Tarquinius Superbus (Tarquin the Proud) is portrayed as a tyrant who ruled through force and violated established customs. According to tradition, his reign was marked by military expansion but also by increasing oppression of the Senate and people. The turning point came with the rape of Lucretia, a noble matron, by Tarquin's son Sextus. Lucretia, shamed by the assault, took her own life after revealing what had happened to her husband and his kinsman Lucius Junius Brutus. Outraged, Brutus led a revolt that expelled Tarquinius Superbus and his family from Rome, ending the monarchy and establishing the Republic in 509 BCE.

Historicity: Mixed; the dramatic narrative of Lucretia's rape is likely legendary, but evidence suggests that Tarquin's reign did end violently and that political upheaval around 509 BCE is plausible. The specific circumstances remain uncertain.

## Political Structure of the Kingdom

The political organization of the Regal Period evolved gradually, incorporating elements from the Indo-European tribal traditions of the Latin and Sabine peoples, the innovations of Etruscan culture, and Rome's own practical needs as an emerging urban center.

### The Monarchy

The king (rex) served as the supreme leader, holding executive, military, and religious authority. The kingship was elective, not hereditary in the strict sense—although successful kings sought to ensure their sons' succession, the Senate technically chose each new king. This practice reflected the oligarchic power of the aristocracy and would later become a point of contention. The king's power was not unlimited; custom (mos maiorum) and the existence of the Senate constrained royal authority.

### The Senate

The Senate (from senex, "old man") consisted of the heads of the major aristocratic families, numbering initially around 100 (later increased by Servius Tullius to 200 or by Tarquinius Priscus, depending on the source). Senators were called patres (fathers), and their families were the patricians—the hereditary aristocracy.

The Senate's primary functions included:
- Advising the king on matters of state
- Approving laws and important decisions
- Selecting candidates for kingship
- Controlling state finances and public lands

While the Senate formally advised rather than commanded, in practice the aristocracy's control of resources, military levies, and religious authority gave them substantial power to constrain the king.

### Assemblies of the People

The people participated in government through assemblies, though these were structured to give greater weight to the wealthy. The primary assembly was the Comitia Curiata (Assembly of Curiae), an older organization based on 30 curiae (subdivisions representing kinship groups). This assembly elected the king, voted on laws, and heard cases involving capital crimes.

With the Servian reforms of the 6th century BCE, the Comitia Centuriata (Assembly of Centuries) was instituted, organizing citizens into military centuries based on property qualification. This assembly became increasingly important for military matters and legislation, and its structure explicitly advantaged wealthy landowners.

### Religious Authority

The king held significant religious responsibilities as chief priest. He presided over sacred rites, interpreted the will of the gods through augury (observing birds) and auspices (various methods of divination), and maintained the state's relationship with the divine. This religious authority reinforced the king's power and legitimized his rule.

## Socio-Economic Structure

Early Roman society was hierarchically organized into distinct classes with different legal rights and social obligations.

### Patricians (Patres Familias)

The patrician class consisted of the heads of aristocratic families who held land, controlled military forces, and dominated the Senate. Patrimonial wealth, primarily in the form of land, was the basis of their power. Patrician families maintained private retinues of dependents and clients, effectively functioning as local power bases. The right to certain religious offices and political positions was restricted to patricians.

### Plebeians

The plebeian class encompassed free citizens of non-aristocratic origin, including small farmers, merchants, artisans, and laborers. Plebeians could own property and participate in assemblies, but they faced significant legal disabilities compared to patricians. They could not hold the highest religious offices and, initially, were excluded from marriage with patricians. Wealthy plebeians could accumulate substantial property but remained excluded from political power.

Plebeians maintained relationships of patronage with patrician landowners. A plebeian client was economically dependent on a patrician patron, receiving land use rights or protection in exchange for political support, military service, and labor. This patron-client relationship (clientela) would remain a defining feature of Roman society for centuries.

### Slaves

Slavery existed in the Kingdom period, though it was probably less extensive than in later centuries. Slaves were acquired through conquest, debt bondage, and purchase. They served as domestic servants, agricultural laborers, and artisans. Slave status was not necessarily permanent—manumission by masters occurred, creating a class of freedmen (liberti) who retained social obligations to their former masters.

### Economic Basis

The economy was primarily agricultural, based on small landholdings and pastoral activities. Landholding was concentrated among the aristocracy, who controlled large estates worked by plebeian tenants, debt-slaves, and slaves. Trade gradually developed, particularly with Etruscan cities to the north and Greek colonies to the south. The introduction of coinage (from Greek and Etruscan sources) was still centuries away; early trade relied on barter and the value of metalwork.

## Culture and Religion

### Religious Practice

Roman religion was deeply practical and ritualistic. The state religion centered on maintaining favorable relationships with the gods through proper sacrifice, ceremony, and respect for religious law. Key religious figures included:

- **Rex Sacrorum (King of the Sacrifice)**: A priest who performed public sacrifices on behalf of the state
- **Flamines**: Specialized priests dedicated to individual gods; the Flamen Dialis served Jupiter, the chief god
- **Pontifex Maximus**: The chief priest responsible for maintaining religious calendar and practices
- **Vestal Virgins**: Six priestesses of the goddess Vesta who maintained the sacred fire in the Temple of Vesta

The Roman pantheon incorporated gods from various sources: Latin deities (Jupiter, Mars, Vesta), Sabine deities, and increasingly Etruscan gods. Jupiter (equivalent to the Greek Zeus) was the supreme deity, associated with sky, justice, and state authority. Mars represented war and agriculture. Vesta represented the hearth and home. Religious practice emphasized ritual correctness and proper form rather than internal belief or moral behavior.

### Architecture and Urban Development

The material culture of Early Rome reflects increasing sophistication and external influences. In the earlier periods, dwellings were simple huts of wood and thatch. By the 6th century BCE, more substantial structures appeared, including the earliest temples. The Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitoline Hill, begun during the reign of Tarquinius Priscus, was the grandest structure yet attempted in Rome, reflecting Etruscan architectural influence and Roman ambition.

The Forum, the central public space, emerged as the civic center where assemblies met, markets operated, and religious ceremonies occurred. Early streets and drainage systems were constructed, including the Cloaca Maxima (Great Drain), traditionally attributed to Tarquinius Priscus, which served to drain the marshy areas and prevent flooding.

### The City Plan

The city was organized into hills and valleys, with the Palatine Hill as the oldest settlement core. The Forum lay in a valley between the Palatine and the Capitol (Capitoline Hill). The Circus Maximus, supposedly founded by Tarquinius Priscus, became the venue for chariot racing, combining entertainment with religious significance. A city wall (the Pomerium) marked the sacred boundary of the city, and gates controlled movement in and out.

## Primary Sources and Evidence

Understanding Early Rome requires careful analysis of available sources:

### Literary Sources

**Livy (Titus Livius, 59 BCE - 17 CE)**: His monumental work "Ab Urbe Condita Libri" (Books from the Founding of the City) is our most detailed narrative source. Livy wrote nearly 800 years after the events he described, drawing on earlier historians, annalistic tradition, and legend. His account is vivid and detailed but often unreliable regarding dates and specific events.

**Plutarch (46-120 CE)**: A Greek historian who wrote biographical sketches ("Lives") comparing famous Greek and Roman figures. His "Life of Romulus" provides alternative narratives and sometimes corrects or supplements Livy.

**Dionysius of Halicarnassus (60 BCE - post 7 CE)**: A Greek historian who provided detailed accounts of Roman antiquities, offering sometimes different chronologies and interpretations than Livy.

**Tacitus (56-120 CE)** and **Florus** (2nd century CE): Later historians who provided summaries and interpretations of early Roman history.

### Archaeological Evidence

Modern archaeology has provided crucial evidence:

- **Hut settlements on the Palatine Hill** (dated to c. 1000 BCE): Confirm habitation but predate the traditional founding date
- **Pottery and artifacts**: Show trade connections with Etruscan cities and Greek colonies
- **Architectural remains**: Including the earliest temples and city infrastructure, confirming some construction traditions
- **Burial sites**: Reveal social organization, wealth distribution, and cultural practices
- **The Cloaca Maxima**: Remains visible, confirming major drainage construction, though not specifically datable to Tarquinius

### Critical Considerations

Scholars recognize that much of the Regal Period narrative, particularly regarding Romulus and the early kings, is mythological. The literary sources were composed centuries after events and drew on legendary material. However, the basic trajectory is credible: Rome developed from scattered settlements into an organized city-state, increasingly influenced by Etruscan culture, with a monarchy that eventually gave way to oligarchic rule. The specific individuals and dates attributed to these developments are often uncertain or fabricated.

## The End of the Kingdom and Transition to the Republic

By the end of the 6th century BCE, Rome had become a significant regional power. Under the later kings, particularly the Tarquins, the city expanded militarily and internally. However, the concentration of power in the hands of individual kings, the perceived abuse of that power, and the growing assertiveness of the aristocracy created tension.

The expulsion of Tarquinius Superbus in 509 BCE marked a turning point. Whether the dramatic narrative of Lucretia's rape is historical or symbolic, the result was clear: the monarchy was abolished and replaced with a republican system in which power was distributed among magistrates, assemblies, and the Senate. The year 509 BCE became the founding date of the Roman Republic, inaugurating a new political era that would shape the Mediterranean world for the next five centuries.

## Conclusion

The Regal Period of Rome (753-509 BCE) saw the transformation of a small settlement into an organized urban center with distinctive institutions, a complex social hierarchy, and cultural practices that would endure long after the monarchy fell. While legendary elements dominate the narrative of Romulus and the early kings, archaeological evidence confirms genuine historical developments: gradual urbanization, Etruscan cultural influence, military and administrative reforms, and the emergence of the Senate as a power center. The fusion of Latin, Sabine, and Etruscan elements created a unique cultural synthesis that became quintessentially Roman. The political structures established during the Kingdom—the Senate, assemblies, magistracies, and the concept of patrician dominance—would be adapted but essentially preserved in the Republic that followed. Understanding Early Rome requires balancing literary narratives against archaeological evidence while recognizing that for Romans themselves, the myths held deep truth about their identity and destiny.
