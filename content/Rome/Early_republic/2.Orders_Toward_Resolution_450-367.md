# Early Republic: The Conflict of the Orders - Toward Resolution

## 1. Introduction – The Struggle Continues

The Twelve Tables had given plebeians written law and formal legal protections, but they had not solved the fundamental problem: plebeians still could not hold the highest offices. The century following 450 BCE would see plebeians intensify their demands for access to magistracies—demands that patricians would fiercely resist before finally conceding in 367 BCE.

## 2. The Gallic Invasion (390 BCE) – Crisis and Disruption

### The Gauls: Who Were They and Where Did They Come From?

To understand the invasion that shocked Rome in 390 BCE, we must first understand who the Gauls were and why they were moving into the Mediterranean world at this time.

The **Gauls** (also called **Celts** or **Galatians** in different regions) were Indo-European peoples originating from Central Europe and the Danube region. They spoke Celtic languages and practiced a warrior culture centered on honor, martial prowess, and aristocratic competition. By the 5th and 4th centuries BCE, Gallic peoples dominated much of Europe north of the Alps and the Mediterranean.

### The Great Celtic Migration: East to West

The Gallic invasion of Italy was part of a larger phenomenon that had been occurring for centuries: the **westward migration of Celtic peoples across Europe**. This was not a single invasion but a gradual, ongoing movement of populations seeking new lands, fleeing overcrowding in their home territories, or pursuing opportunities for conquest and settlement.

**The Pattern of Celtic Expansion:**

Starting in the 8th-7th centuries BCE, Celtic peoples began expanding from their core territories in Central Europe (the Danube basin, modern-day Austria and Hungary) toward the west and south. This expansion occurred in waves and through different routes:

- **Northward and Westward**: Celtic peoples moved into what is today France, Britain, Ireland, and the Iberian Peninsula
- **Southward**: Celtic tribes pushed into the Mediterranean, seeking warmer lands and opportunities for conquest
- **Eastward**: Some Celtic groups moved toward the Black Sea region and Anatolia (modern Turkey)

This expansion was driven by several factors:

**Population pressure**: Celtic territories were becoming overcrowded. As populations grew, competition for land intensified. Younger sons and ambitious warriors had limited prospects at home, so they sought new territories to conquer and settle.

**Warrior culture**: Celtic society valued martial prowess and glory. Warriors who could lead successful raids and conquests gained prestige and wealth. This cultural emphasis on warfare created incentive for aggressive expansion.

**Technological advantage**: Celtic peoples possessed superior iron-working technology compared to many peoples they encountered. Celtic iron weapons and armor gave them military advantage, making conquest possible.

**Opportunity**: As Mediterranean civilizations (Greek city-states, Etruscan cities, early Rome) developed wealth and power, Celtic warriors saw opportunities for plunder and conquest. Wealthy Mediterranean societies were attractive targets.

### Celtic Arrival in Italy

By the 5th century BCE, Celtic tribes had begun penetrating into Italy from the north. They crossed the Alps and settled in the Po River valley (what Romans called **Cisalpine Gaul**—"Gaul on this side of the Alps"). These Celtic settlers gradually pushed out earlier populations and established themselves as the dominant power in northern Italy.

The Celtic tribes in northern Italy existed in a state of constant competition with each other and with neighboring peoples. Rome, expanding northward from the Latin region, came into conflict with these Gallic tribes. However, Rome was not yet strong enough to conquer them decisively—the balance of power was uncertain.

### The Specific Invasion: Brennus and His Army (390 BCE)

In this context of Gallic settlement and northern Italian competition, a particular Gallic army under the leadership of **Brennus** advanced toward Rome in 390 BCE. The exact reasons for this invasion are unclear—possibly Brennus was seeking plunder, possibly he was responding to Roman aggression, possibly he was leading a migration of his people seeking new territories.

### The Northern Threat

Whatever Brennus's motivations, the Gallic army represented an unprecedented threat to Rome. Rome had fought against neighboring Italian peoples—Aequi, Volsci, Latins—but had not faced such a massive, militarily sophisticated force as the Gallic warriors brought.

The Gallic fighting style was alien to Roman experience. Gallic warriors were large, strong men who fought with abandon and ferocity. They used long swords, fought in loose formations, and relied on sheer aggression and strength rather than disciplined tactics. To Romans trained in more rigid formations and disciplined tactics, the Gallic charge was terrifying.

### The Invasion and Battle of the Allia

In 390 BCE, the Gallic army advanced toward Rome. Roman forces met the Gauls at the Allia River, a tributary of the Tiber about 11 miles north of Rome. The battle was a disaster. The Roman army was routed—crushed by Gallic warriors whose tactics, weapons, and sheer aggression overwhelmed Roman military organization.

The sources describe the battle as a slaughter. Roman soldiers fled in panic. The defeat left Rome's city undefended. The Gallic army advanced on Rome itself, sacking the city and occupying it for several months. This was the first time since the expulsion of the Tarquins that a foreign power had breached Rome's defenses.

### The Impact on Roman Society

The Gallic invasion was traumatic for Rome—it shattered the perception that Rome was invincible and threatened the city's existence. The invasion also had significant social consequences:

**Military reorganization**: Rome had to rebuild its army and improve its military organization. The old system had failed catastrophically against the Gallic threat. This necessity for military innovation would affect both patrician and plebeian roles in defense.

**Social cohesion**: The existential threat temporarily muted the Conflict of the Orders. Patricians and plebeians had to work together to defend Rome and expel the Gauls. This period of cooperation, though temporary, established precedent for plebeian military importance.

**Patrician authority weakened**: The military disaster undermined patrician confidence and authority. How could patrician generals claim superiority when their leadership had led to such catastrophic defeat?

### Recovery and Expulsion

Eventually, Roman forces regrouped. Under the leadership of Camillus (a patrician general, though the historical reliability of sources about Camillus is disputed), the Romans expelled the Gauls and rebuilt the city. The invasion lasted several months before the Gauls withdrew north, possibly due to plague or disease.

### The Delayed Resolution

Interestingly, some historians argue that the Gallic invasion delayed plebeian progress toward political equality. The military crisis gave patricians an excuse to postpone internal reforms—"We must first deal with external threats; internal politics can wait." However, once the immediate crisis passed and Rome recovered, plebeian pressure resumed more forcefully than before.

## 3. Continued Plebeian Pressure – The Second Century of Conflict

### The Resumption of Political Demands

After the recovery from the Gallic invasion, plebeians resumed their demands for political access with renewed intensity. The military contribution plebeians had made to Rome's defense during and after the invasion gave them additional leverage. How could patricians claim plebeians were unfit for office when plebeians had fought to save Rome?

### Demands for Access to Priesthoods

One major plebeian demand was access to priesthoods. In the early Republic, all major priesthoods—augurs, pontifices, and others—were reserved for patricians. Plebeians demanded the right to hold these religious offices, both for the authority they conferred and for the wealth they generated (priests received portions of sacrificial animals and religious fees).

### Demands for Access to Magistracies

More importantly, plebeians demanded access to all magistracies:

- **Quaestorships**: Financial offices that provided wealth and prestige
- **Praetorships**: Judicial offices created in the 360s BCE
- **Aedileships**: Public works offices that provided opportunities for display and favor
- **The Consulship**: The highest office, still exclusively patrician

The consulship was the symbolic prize. As long as plebeians could not become consuls, they could claim they were fundamentally excluded from power. Access to the consulship would represent true equality.

### Patrician Resistance Continues

Despite plebeian demands backed by the threat of military secession, patricians resisted. They were willing to make small concessions—creating new offices (like the praetorship) that plebeians could eventually access—but they defended their core privileges fiercely.

Patrician arguments included:

- **Ancestry and natural superiority**: Patricians claimed their noble lineage made them natural rulers
- **Religious qualifications**: Patricians claimed they possessed special religious knowledge necessary for priesthoods and magistracies
- **Tradition**: Patricians invoked *mos maiorum*—ancestral custom—claiming that exclusive patrician rule was ancient tradition
- **Property and military capability**: Patricians argued that magistracies required wealth and military experience, which they possessed in greater measure

### The Impasse

For decades after the Gallic invasion, the situation was essentially stalemated. Plebeians had enough power (through the tribune office and threat of secession) to block patrician initiatives. Patricians had enough institutional dominance to prevent plebeian access to power. Neither side could force the other to capitulate.

## 4. The Licinian Rogations – Failed Attempts at Reform

### The First Proposals

By the 370s BCE, political leaders recognized that the conflict needed resolution. A series of reform proposals emerged, traditionally attributed to the tribunes **Gaius Licinius** and **Lucius Sextius**. These two tribunes, both plebeians, became the faces of plebeian reform efforts during this period. Their names gave rise to the term "Licinian Rogations" (*rogatio* = proposal in Latin). For over a decade, Licinius and Sextius repeatedly introduced reform proposals, using their tribune positions to push for change.

The reformers understood that piecemeal concessions would not satisfy plebeian demands. Instead, they proposed a comprehensive package of reforms that addressed the major grievances plebeians had articulated over the previous century. These proposals attempted to address fundamental inequalities in political access, religious authority, economic opportunity, and land ownership.

**The Main Proposals Reportedly Included:**

**1. One Consul Must Be Plebeian**

This was the cornerstone of the reforms. The proposal mandated that at least one of the two consuls elected each year must be plebeian. Any election in which both consuls were patricians would be invalid and would require a new election.

This was revolutionary because it directly attacked patrician monopoly on the highest office. The consulship was not merely a position of power—it was the symbol of political authority in Rome. A plebeian consul would demonstrate to all of Rome and the Mediterranean world that plebeians were capable of governing. No longer could patricians claim that plebeians were naturally inferior or unfit for supreme authority.

The reform also created a practical mechanism: shared consulship would force patrician and plebeian cooperation in the highest office. A plebeian consul could veto a patrician consul's decisions (through the mutual veto power consuls possessed), creating a check on each other's authority and preventing either class from dominating executive power.

**2. Access to the Dictatorships**

Beyond regular magistracies, the proposal demanded plebeian access to the **dictatorship**—a supreme emergency office created for times of military crisis. During war or internal emergency, the Republic could appoint a dictator with absolute power, limited only by a six-month term. The dictator outranked consuls and held unprecedented authority.

Dictatorships were rare (appointed only in genuine crises), but they were immensely powerful. By keeping this office exclusively patrician, patricians ensured they could seize emergency power during crises. The reform proposal demanded that plebeians could also be appointed dictators, ending this last bastion of exclusive patrician power.

**3. Debt Relief**

The proposal addressed one of the original sources of plebeian grievance: **debt slavery**. For centuries, creditors (usually patrician) could enslave debtors (usually plebeian) who could not repay loans. A plebeian farmer facing crop failure or a merchant facing commercial loss could become enslaved to his patrician creditor.

The debt relief provision (though the exact terms are unclear from our sources) likely established limits on creditor power. Possibly it capped interest rates, required creditors to accept partial repayment, or prohibited enslavement for certain types of debt. The goal was to break the cycle where economic misfortune led directly to slavery.

This was crucial because debt slavery had been a primary driver of plebeian political agitation since the early Republic. Addressing it would remove one major source of economic grievance and suffering.

**4. Land Distribution**

The proposal addressed plebeian demands for access to public land (*ager publicus*). Rome had acquired vast tracts of land through conquest—territory taken from defeated enemies. This public land was theoretically available for distribution to Roman citizens, but in practice it had been monopolized by wealthy patricians.

The reform proposal demanded fair distribution of public land to plebeians, particularly to poor plebeians who had fought in Rome's armies. Those who had risked their lives defending Rome should share in the benefits of Rome's territorial expansion. This would address economic inequality and give plebeians a stake in Rome's success.

### The Radical Nature of These Proposals

Taken together, these proposals represented a fundamental restructuring of Roman society. They were not minor adjustments but comprehensive reforms addressing political access, religious authority, economic opportunity, and land ownership.

For patricians, accepting these proposals meant surrendering the privileges that had defined their class identity for centuries. It meant sharing power, giving up economic advantages (through debt relief and land redistribution), and accepting plebeians as equals.

This is why patrician resistance was so fierce. These were not trivial matters of procedure or precedent—they struck at the heart of patrician dominance.

### Patrician Opposition and Obstruction

The Licinian proposals faced fierce patrician resistance. Patrician tribunes (who, despite their name, could be either patrician or plebeian) used their veto power to block reform efforts. The sources describe a decade or more of political deadlock—the tribunes proposing reforms, patricians blocking them, year after year.

This period demonstrates how evenly balanced power had become. Neither side could force through their agenda. Patricians could block reform, but they could not prevent plebeians from proposing it. Plebeians could propose reform, but they could not force patrician acceptance.

### The Growing Pressure

However, plebeian pressure continued to mount. Each year that reform was blocked, plebeian frustration increased. The threat of military secession hung over every negotiation. Patricians faced a choice: either make concessions or risk plebeian refusal to serve in Rome's armies, which would leave Rome defenseless.

## 5. The Breakthrough – The Licinian Laws (367 BCE)

### The Resolution

After years of deadlock, patricians finally capitulated. The exact circumstances are uncertain—the sources don't clearly explain why patricians suddenly agreed after resisting for so long. Possibilities include:

- **Military necessity**: Rome faced threats from neighboring peoples (Volsci, Aequi) that required military strength; plebeian military secession became unbearable
- **Political compromise**: Some patrician faction decided that partial concession was better than risking total conflict
- **Constitutional exhaustion**: After years of blocked proposals, compromise became inevitable

Whatever the cause, in 367 BCE, the **Licinian Laws** (*Leges Liciniae Sextiae*) were finally passed.

### What the Licinian Laws Established

**1. One Consul Must Be Plebeian**

The most important provision: at least one of the two consuls must be plebeian. This meant that plebeians could now hold Rome's highest office. The first plebeian consul, Lucius Sextius, was elected in 366 BCE.

This was a symbolic and practical victory. Plebeians could now claim true political equality—they could aspire to the highest office. The consulship carried military authority, judicial power, and immense prestige. Access to it fundamentally changed plebeian status.

**2. Limits on Office Holding**

The law established that no one could hold the same magistracy twice within 10 years, and no one could hold multiple magistracies simultaneously. This was partly designed to prevent individual accumulation of power, but it also meant that plebeians would get opportunities to hold office—more people had to cycle through positions.

**3. Debt Relief**

The law reportedly addressed debt slavery, though the exact provisions are unclear from our sources. It likely established limits on creditor power and protections against arbitrary enslavement.

**4. Land Distribution**

The law addressed distribution of public land, though again the specific terms are disputed by modern scholars.

### The Broader Significance

The Licinian Laws represented a fundamental shift in Roman politics. For the first time, plebeians and patricians would share high office on a regular basis. The patrician monopoly on the consulship was broken. Within a few decades, plebeians would also access other offices—praetorships, priesthoods, and eventually the censorship.

## 6. The Significance and Limitations

### What Changed

The Licinian Laws fundamentally altered Roman political structure:

**Political power distributed**: Rather than patrician monopoly on all high offices, power was now shared with plebeians. Both classes could aspire to consulship, other magistracies, and religious positions.

**Precedent for further reforms**: The breakthrough in 367 BCE established that change was possible. Once plebeians held the consulship, excluding them from other offices became harder to justify.

**Plebeian confidence**: The victory gave plebeians confidence and momentum. They could point to plebeian consuls as proof that they were capable of governing.

**Institutional legitimacy**: Rather than govern through threat and veto, plebeians now governed through direct participation in magistracies. This strengthened the Republic's legitimacy—it was no longer purely patrician rule resisted by excluded masses.

### What Did NOT Change

However, the Licinian Laws did not create true equality:

**Aristocratic dominance continued**: Both patricians and plebeians who held high office were wealthy landowners and aristocrats. The laws did not reduce aristocratic dominance over the common masses—they only shared it between two aristocratic factions.

**The masses remained excluded**: Ordinary plebeians still could not hold office. Only wealthy, prominent plebeians could aspire to magistracies. The poorest plebeians gained little from plebeian access to consulship.

**Economic inequality**: The laws did not redistribute wealth or land in ways that fundamentally reduced economic inequality between rich and poor.

**Religious authority**: Full plebeian access to priesthoods took longer to achieve. Some priesthoods remained closed to plebeians even after the Licinian Laws.

### A New Phase Rather Than an End

The Licinian Laws did not end the Conflict of the Orders—they transformed it. Rather than a conflict between patricians and plebeians, politics increasingly became competition between individual aristocratic families (both patrician and plebeian) for dominance. The conflict was no longer about whether plebeians could participate in power, but about which families and factions would control that power.

## 7. Conclusion – From Conflict to Integration

The period from 450-367 BCE saw the gradual resolution of the Conflict of the Orders. What had seemed like an intractable division—patrician monopoly on power versus plebeian exclusion—proved to be negotiable. Through the threat of military secession, use of the tribune's veto, and simple persistence over generations, plebeians forced patricians to share power.

The Licilian Laws of 367 BCE represent a watershed moment. They established the principle that magistracies were open to merit and status, not reserved by birth alone. They created a Republic in which both patricians and plebeians could govern. This did not mean equality—wealth and family still determined access to power—but it meant shared access rather than monopoly.

The resolution of the Conflict of the Orders set the stage for the next phase of Roman development: the conquest of Italy and the Mediterranean. With internal political structure stabilized, Rome could focus on external expansion—a focus that would occupy the next centuries and eventually make Rome a world power.

The Conflict of the Orders, which had seemed like it might tear the Republic apart, instead became the crucible in which Roman republican institutions were forged. The tensions between different groups in society, rather than destroying the system, reshaped it into something more durable and flexible.
